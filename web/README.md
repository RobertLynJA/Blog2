# Next.js + Jest

This example shows how to configure Jest to work with Next.js and Babel. Since the release of Next.js 12, Next.js has in-built configuration for Jest with SWC. See the [with-jest](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-jest) example for the latest implementation.

This includes Next.js' built-in support for Global CSS, CSS Modules and TypeScript.

## How to Use

Quickly get started using [Create Next App](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app#readme)!

In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-jest-babel with-jest-babel-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-jest-babel with-jest-babel-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-jest-babel with-jest-babel-app
```
